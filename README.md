This website lists characters saved on the swapi and loads them onto the page through http get. 
This list has a little important data that is showed to the user like the gender of the character and when they were born.
You can filter throught the character list and search for what character you want to know more information about.
When you want to know more about a certain character and see their image, you can click on the name from the character list.
This brings you to a new screen which has the image and numerous information about the character from swapi. The image comes from the
other api used, starwars-visualguide api through http get. There are also buttons to navigate the page so you can go back to the search screen.
